# CSVuploader_backend
The project has been made using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and React. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating the project:

# Set Up Backend:
1. Create a directory "server" inside the project directory "CSV_Uploader"

2. Initialize a new Node.js project by running 

## `npm init` 

4. Install the necessary dependencies by running the command: 

## `npm install`

6. Make sure that a uploads directory created in the same directory as the server.js file. This is where the uploaded CSV files will be stored temporarily.

7.To run the application, open two separate terminals.  One for backend & another for frontend.

8.Finally, in the "server" directory, run the following command to start the server.

### `npm start`
